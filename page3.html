      <p>Treatment is becoming more and more effective in the US through intensive research. As seen above, mental health care is extremely effective with increasing reliability. When results show reliability decreasing, there could be many reasons for why this may be occurring.
        A patient could be enrolled in the incorrect treatment or still testing the waters. Finding the right therapist can take many different rounds of therapy, and finding the right medication can cause symptoms to become worse until the right medication is found. 
      Furthermore, environmental factors need to be taken into account. Even effective mental health care can only do so much if the patient's environment is the main trigger.<br>
    <br>
      To find help, seek a diagnosis from a health care professional to determine the correct treatment(s). Treatments include the following:<br>
      Psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Exposure Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, etc.) <br>
      Medication <br>
      Case Management <br>
      Hospilization (Inpatient, Outpatient, Residential, etc.) <br>
      Support Group <br>
     </p>
      <h3>Why talk about mental health?</h3>
      <p>Overall, there are clear gaps between mental illness and mental health treatment. While there is an increase in mental health education, education and treatment needs to be targeted towards specific groups who are not getting the treatment they need.
        Furthermore, bringing mental health to the table may help individuals understand their own mental health, such as mental illness factors and when to seek help.
